# Simple and Portable QRP Automatic Antenna Tuner
This is a first prototype for a QRP automatic antenna tuner. The final revision should provide

 [x] Small form factor. The chasis is already set: It should fit nicely into a 10 x 10 x 3cm
     Fischer chasis.
 [x] Tune a random wire of 10m-ish length + 1:9 UnUn on all Bands from 80m to 10m.
 [ ] Battery powered. The chasis should contain a rechargeable battery including its charging
     circuit.
 [ ] Using bi-stable relays the tuner should only consume power during the actual tuning.
     This increases the battery live extensively.

## Revision 0
The first prototype lacks the battery and bistable relays. Hence, it is just a platform to develop
and optimize the firmware.
